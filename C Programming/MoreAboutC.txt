High-Level Language (HLL) kya hoti hai?
Definition (Simple):

Aisi language jisme code human-friendly hota hai
aur machine ke kaise kaam karta uski tension nahi hoti.

Examples:

Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Go

Features:
English jaisa readable syntax
Memory management automatic
Garbage collection hota hai
Developer productivity high
Built-in library bahot saari
Portability easy (ek code multiple OS me)
Abstraction high (machine-level details hidden)


Low-Level Language (LLL) kya hoti hai?
Definition (Simple):

Aisi language jo machine ke close hoti hai.
Har cheez manually manage karna padta hai → memory, CPU instructions, etc.

Types:
Machine Language (0s and 1s) – pure hardware
Assembly Language (mnemonics) – MOV, ADD, MUL
C is not pure low-level—
but C ko often low-level ke near bola jata hai → "middle-level language".

Middle-Level Language (Like C)

C ko middle-level bolte because:
High-level features (functions, loops, variables)
Low-level access (pointers, memory address, hardware access) 
Isliye C is perfect mix.


Main Components of a Computer

A computer system 2 parts me divide hota hai:
1️⃣ Hardware
2️⃣ Software

1. Hardware (Physical Parts)
A. Input Devices
Input devices wo hote hain jisse user data aur instructions computer ko deta hai.Input devices allow external data to enter the computer system.
Keyboard
Mouse
Scanner
Mic
Webcam
Touchscreen

B. Output Devices
Computer jo result deta hai, woh ye devices show karte hain.
Monitor
Printer
Speaker
Projector

C. CPU (Central Processing Unit) – The Brain
CPU 3 parts ka combination hai:

1. ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Ke kaam: calculation + logic. All actual calculations happen inside ALU.
Examples: addition, subtraction, AND, OR, comparison

2. CU (Control Unit)
Flow control karta hai.CU acts like the traffic controller of the computer.Manages data flow between memory, ALU, I/O
Instructions ko fetch, decode, execute karwata hai.

3. Registers
Super-fast temporary storage.Registers remove the delay of memory access and make execution faster.
CPU ke andar hota hai.

Why Registers are fast ?
Registers CPU ke andar hote hain
RAM CPU ke bahar motherboard par hoti hai.
Waha tak signal ko jaana–aana padta hai → time lagta hai (nanoseconds).
But registers CPU ke chip ke andar hoti hain.
Zero travel distance → almost instant access.
👉 Isliye register access fastest hota hai.


D. Memory (Primary Memory)
1. RAM (Random Access Memory)
Temporary memory. RAM decides how many programs you can run at a time
Programs running state me store hote hain
Power off → data lost
2. ROM (Read Only Memory)
Permanent memory.System starts from ROM.
Booting instructions stored (BIOS/UEFI)

E. Secondary Storage
Permanent storage.
HDD
SSD
USB drive
CD/DVD

F. Motherboard
Largest circuit board
Sab components ko connect karta hai:
CPU, RAM, storage, ports, power, GPU, etc.Motherboard is the backbone that connects all components

G. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
Images, video, gaming, ML tasks handle karta hai. GPU is specialized for massive parallel computations
Example: NVIDIA, AMD GPUs
CPU se zyda parallel computation karta hai.

8. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
AC → DC convert karta hai
Saare components ko stable power deta hai
“Without PSU, no component can run.”


2. Software (Programs)
A. System Software
Hardware ko operate karne wala software
Example:
Operating System (Windows, Linux, macOS)
Device drivers
Firmware


How a program runs in a computer
1. You write a program (source code)
int main() {
    printf("Hello");
}
Ye code high-level language me hota hai jise machine samajh nahi sakti.

2.Compiler converts it to machine code
C me compiler (GCC/Clang) code ko teen stages me convert karta hai:
🔹 A. Preprocessing
#include resolve hota hai
macros expand hote hain
Output: expanded code

🔹 B. Compilation
High-level code → Assembly code
(CPU-friendly instructions)

🔹 C. Assembly → Machine Code
Assembly → binary (0/1)
Machine code = executable file (.exe or a.out)
Now the program is ready for execution.

Loader loads the program into RAM
Program disk me pada hota hai.
Run karte hi OS ka loader:
program ko RAM me copy karta hai
stack, heap, code segment, data segment set karta hai
required libraries (printf, malloc) load karta hai
 CPU ke liye RAM hi actual workspace hota hai.


CPU starts executing code
CPU execution follow karta hai:
⭐ Fetch → Decode → Execute cycle
🔹 A. Fetch
CPU instruction pointer (Rip/EIP) se instruction read karta hai from RAM.
🔹 B. Decode
CU (Control Unit) instruction ko samajhta hai:
ye add hai?
print hai?
load/store hai?
🔹 C. Execute
ALU operation karta hai
Registers me values aati-jati hain
Memory read/write hota hai
Ye cycle har instruction ke liye repeat hota hai.

5. Program uses memory (stack + heap)
🔹 Stack
Functions ke variables
Return addresses
Very fast
Automatic allocation
🔹 Heap
Dynamic memory (malloc, new)
Programmer controlled
Slower than stack

Simple: A program runs through compilation, loading, and execution.
First, the compiler converts source code into machine code.
Then the OS loader loads it into RAM and sets up stack/heap.
The CPU then executes the machine instructions using the Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
During execution, the program interacts with memory and OS through system calls.
Finally, when execution ends, the OS frees all resources.


****** C-Tokens: -> Keyword, Identifiers, Literals(Constants), Operators


Keywords: Keywords are reserved words in C whose meaning is already defined by the language.
We cannot use them as variable names or identifiers.

auto,break,case ,char ,const ,continue, default ,do,double ,else,enum ,extern,float ,for ,goto,if,int,long,register ,return,short ,signed ,sizeof,static,struct,switch,typedef,union,unsigned,void ,volatile,while.

Identifiers are the names we give to variables, functions, arrays, structures, etc.which are manually defined by us.
Naming rule:
Can contain:
alphabets (a–z, A–Z)
digits (0–9)
underscore (_)

Cannot start with a digit
Correct: age1
Wrong: 1age

Cannot use a keyword as identifier
Wrong: int return = 5;

Case-sensitive
Age ≠ age

No spaces
Wrong: total amount

No special symbols
Wrong: a%b, name!

Literals are fixed constant values written directly in the program.
Their value run-time par change nahi hota.

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

-89%20 = 20 me aisa kya multiply kare ki value less than -89 mile , so 20 *-5 = -100, so -100 me kitna add kare ki -89 aaye i.e 11 , so final output answer is 11.

-5%3 = 3*-2 will give -6, so if we add 1 to -6 it gives -5. so final answer is 1.
